We will begin with the basics: what is NLP and how does it fit within the field of Machine Learning and Data Science? We will consider how is it used in business vs academic contexts, what are the common business use cases, and what sort of questions can be answered through NLP.\nFirst we will begin by exploring a text based data set. We will then deal with common procedures for cleaning and normalizing text, and from there will explore different methods for representing text computationally and business problems that call for these different representations. Examples include: topic modelin,g which allows us to understand key themes within a large body of text; text classification, in which text is used to make predictions, i.e. identifying spam or positive/negative sentiments; and named entity recognition, where we identify the entities to which specific words refer.\nThe purpose of these examples are accessible and simple practices that relate to business problems. These are common procedures that are found in a wide variety of contexts for which NLP can aid in problem solving. This presentation will be digestable for a wide range of audiences while providing a foundation into the field of natual language processing. The goal of this presentation is for everyone to walk away with a deeper understanding of the field and a basic understanding of how to approach NLP problems.\nIt is time to demystify NLP and make some of these deepers concepts accessible to a larger audience. Bridging the gap between those who rely on this technology and the people who build it is paramount to the success of any business project, and the aim of this presentation is to build that understanding."

Thereâs a connected home with a voice assistant that uses devices around the house to do things for the family. With the IoT devices available on the market today we can have that home of the future.\nThe problem with setting up that futuristic home is you likely have a variety of different devices that youâre trying to control with a number of different platforms. Itâs too disconnected and using an assistant like Google or Alexa can limit what you could potentially do with these cool technologies. However with Home Assistant we can collect data from a variety of different sources, run it through a workflow, and output it to any device we want on our network. The number of cool scenarios you can create is limitless. In this session weâll talk about how to set it up and run through basic functionality so you can hit the ground running when you get back home."

We will show the entire lifecycle from data ingestion using sensors, data cleaning, model creation/training, deployment, and then finally some predictions on the device. We will be using sensor data and executing code on device.\nIf done in person, Iâm thinking we would run this as a hands-on workshop with attendees either:\n1. Purchasing hardware before the event\n2. Using their cell phone as the device and weâll use the sensors on the device with a mobile application.\nIn either case, we would wire together a few quick prototypes and use much of the work done by a company called Edge Impulse to help us with the heavy lifting. Iâm open to a variety of options depending on what you think the audience would like.

That is just one of many recent rulings holding businesses accountable for accessibility. Not to mention that 1 in 5 visitors to your website will have some form of disability - that's 20% of your users! This isn't only for public facing websites, either. The ADA also requires internal websites to be accessible.\nThis session outlines the business case for accessibility - why it's important and what the ROI for accessibility could be - as well as presenting the possible costs associated with ignoring accessibility.

The number one request afterwards was to make it into a Workshop! So this year at the best Summer Camp for geeks, weâll all make our own XR games hands-on!\nThe Meta Quest 2 has sold over 10 MILLION devices! XR has broken through to the mainstream and if you donât own one yourself, you likely know someone who does.\nWhat does that mean for you? Well you now have a captive market that is HUNGRY for new XR games!\nSo together in this workshop weâll build a XR game using Unity, Visual Studio and C#\nWeâll start from a new project in the latest Unity and walk all the way through the process of building a XR game and running it on a Quest 2.\nNote #1 -- If you attended last year, this will be a totally new XR game with a lot more features and interactions.\nNote #2 -- Lance will bring several Quests with him, and allow you to run your games on the devices! BUT if you have your own Quest - BRING IT! That or use this as an excellent excuse to invest $299 and start building the XR future!\nNote #3 -- If you want to get a jump on development, check out www.LanceLarsen.com for a lot of introductory blog articles on building on the Quest 2.\nLance Larsen is a Microsoft MVP for Mixed Reality and passionate community speaker. Lance has led MADdotNET, the Madison .NET User Community for over 15 years - www.MADdotNET.com. He's also the CTO for Holosoft, a company focused on XR (Augmented, Virtual and Mixed Reality) technologies - www.Holosoft.com."

Or do they nod their head, agreeing there's a potential (maybe even small) risk, but then take no further actions to prepare for that dreaded day?\nI've been there. We talk about cyber risks and the threats they pose to our business, but the business doesn't seem to take a real interest...until the inevitable happens. We've been exposed to a potential cyber attack. An employee clicks on a phishing email and enters their credentials. The tech community is in a panic, wondering if they are affected by the newly exposed library vulnerability. A developer resigns after only 2 weeks of work...what did they do in that short amount of time?! When these things happen, the business becomes ultra sensitive to \"shiny\" threats and wants answers...fast. And because the spotlight is now on these issues, we make decisions that don't necessarily make sense or we miss the obvious.\nThis is where planning is key. We never plan to fail, but we do fail to plan which then leads to more unanswered questions, undefined risks and potentially more sleepless nights. One of the best ways I've seen to help bring cyber threats to life is to perform a tabletop exercise. A tabletop exercise joins all key parties together to simulate a real-life event. I will walk you through the steps of planning and executing this exercise with your senior leadership team as well as with your tech team. It will shake out the bugs and point out the areas where more planning is needed. If you are well prepared for the dreadful attack, it won't seem as bad because you've proactively thought through what needs to happen.\nLastly, I will give you a peek into our approach at a Cyber Attack Plan. This plan outlines different threats and is a great tool to use during a tabletop exercise. My goal is for you to leave, feeling confident about how you can plan for the inevitable - because you are never able to fully remove your cyber security risk."

Weâre going to provide an overview and live demonstration of Looker, which is an analytics and business intelligence platform with a developer-friendly architecture. It leverages LookML, short for Lookerâs âmodeling layer,â which puts SQL into reusable components. LookML allows you to define a metric once for wide use across the platform so that everyone is using the same definition. If that metric logic changes, developers can make the update in that first location and the change cascades to every other place where the metric is referenced.\nWe will demonstrate how the modeling layer empowers business users to access trusted data to build their own dashboards, utilize self-service, and execute other types of data experiences like alerting, scheduling, and integrations with 3rd party applications. Some examples of these integrations include workflows with Salesforce, Marketo, Google Ads, Slack, Teams, and Twilio.\nYou will walk away understanding both the technical and business values of LookML in addressing data bottlenecks and data chaos in an organization."

Spreadsheets can be used for storing, managing, and visualizing your businessâs data, but are external workbooks really the most effective way to do this?\nMost applications today have a way for the user to export data to a spreadsheet workbook. Once exported the data can be analyzed and visualized using the spreadsheet software. However, once the data is exported from the application, it is isolated from your database and could be using out-of-date data. In addition to this, external workbooks are un-secure, prone to errors, and have no version control.\nSo how can we harness the power of a spreadsheet while trying to avoid some of the problems that it can cause? We cannot depend on spreadsheets, but they are necessary for our businesses to run smoothly.\nDuring this presentation will discuss how we can harness the benefits of a spreadsheet directly within our JavaScript application using the spreadsheet API SpreadJS. Come see how fast and easy it is to get up and running with SpreadJS and learn more about the features and customization abilities our spreadsheet component offers!"

We built a system using a combination of our own carefully coded services, some purchased or open-source systems we deploy to VMâs or functions, and a cloud providerâs systems. It was all working so well and then... it just isnât. Itâs too slow, it is throwing errors, itâs timing out, itâs forcing me to put off leaving at the end of the day for a nice visit to the woods to recuperate. Looking at log messages, ok, how did that handful of systems produce that many messages. How can I look at that pile of gibberish and figure out what is going on? Running on my local computer, maybe I could debug this, but I donât even know enough to set up the matching scenario to trigger this problem. Should we add more logging? NOOOOOOO!\nOpenTelemetry helps solve this problem by standardizing how to correlate and track activities across all your systems. The language and platform specific libraries and SDKâs make it much simpler to implement tracing in your own applications and correlate activities across the whole distributed network of nodes you call home. It is usable in all platforms so much of what weâll talk about is applicable to GCP, Azure and AWS. It doesnât replace logging but being able to associate logs with traces provides a wonderful way to filter log entries. Some of the foundations of this started in Google as OpenCensus and so this way of tackling the problem is baked into how GCP works. So, weâll explore the setup of a few services running in GCP with Google Trace, OpenTelemetry and Google Logging libraries and try to tame this beast. The demo will be code and query heavy, showing requests originating from REST endpoints, graphql, and pubsub. It will also show how tracing correlates those requests to CloudSql, Google Cloud Storage and other built-in systems. The services will be in node.js, python and c# to show a bigger cross section of implementations."

This move toward a functional style should be particularly welcome for data platform specialists, who already have a leg up in understanding functional programming concepts thanks to their work with SQL.\nIn this talk, we will focus on one functional programming language, F#.

A Service Level Objective (SLO) sets the target for an SLI, for example error rate over the past five minutes should be larger than 99.9%. A good SLO is one that, when barely met, would keep a typical user happy. When that SLO is not met, your users will eventually stop using your service or go to a competitor.\nTrends of SLIs can help spot a system failure before users experience outages, trigger an auto scale of cloud infrastructure system, or indicate that downstream dependencies are silently failing. SLO violations can alert the team that something is wrong with your system.\nAfter learning the key terms and concepts the demo will turn interactive to work together to create several SLIs and SLIOs for an imaginary system."

If you come from a Java or C# background then TypeScript will feel very familiar to you. If you come from a JavaScript background you may want to consider TypeScript for the improvements you get in IDE tooling and code maintainability.\nIn this session weâll start out with a discussion of what TypeScript is and why you should consider using it. Then weâll look at TypeScript code to learn the basic concepts and features of the language including how to define and use types, interfaces, classes and generics as well as how to create and consume modules. By the end of this presentation you will have enough information to get started writing your own web or Node.js applications in a more stable and maintainable way.\nIn the most recent Stack Overflow developer survey TypeScript was ranked as one of the most loved programming languages. Come see why in this informative introduction to TypeScript."

It was a time when security awareness was limited, countermeasures and best practices werenât broadly applied, and attackers explored, compromised, controlled, and exfiltrated data from systems with minimal resistance. In short, enterprise IoT security sucks as bad today as that unpatched Windows NT 3.51 server with an RS-232 connected modem that IT forgot about.\nWorking globally with Fortune 500 enterprises and government agencies weâve interrogated over two million production IoT devices. Across these two million devices weâve identified threats and trends, compiled statistics, summarized compelling cases, and evaluated common offenders. Weâve also assembled tactics that organizations can employ to recognize value from their IoT devices while minimizing risk and ensuring that devices that are secure today will stay secure tomorrow.\nSecurity issues are compounded by the quantity of IoT devices. Our analysis indicates that most organizations have about five IoT devices per employee. The global IoT market has grown from $100 billion in 2017 to over $1 trillion in 2022. There are over 46 billion connected devices today and 30 billion (65%) of those devices are IoT. We are increasingly dependent on consumer, enterprise, industrial, and military IoT devices for cost reduction, supply chain logistics, productivity gains, security, and everything in between. Despite the criticality of IoT, our security hasnât kept pace. In the enterprise, weâve identified that we simply donât know:\n- What IoT devices we have - guesses based on legacy asset discovery solutions are consistently off by at least 50%\n- When our firmware was last updated - in many cases the firmware is end of life and the average IoT firmware age is six years\n- If our credentials follow organizational policies - passwords that are default, low-quality, donât have scheduled rotations, and lack centralized management are the norm\n- How vulnerable our IoT devices are - at least half of the IoT devices weâve interrogated have known, high to critical level CVEs\nWhile enterprise IoT security currently sucks, it doesnât have to be that way. By evaluating the security risks and the inherent limitations of IoT, you can leverage tactics that will have a rapid and positive impact on security."

Additionally, modern cloud architectures have many cloud dependencies, which are difficult to use for local development. Day-to-day work can be a real hassle.\nThe Distributed Application Runtime, aka Dapr, makes your life easier. With Dapr, you can build against an environment that runs great on your local machine or in the cloud. It abstracts away all those pesky cloud dependencies, so you have ultimate portability. It supports all your favorite programming languages and whatever cloud provider you're into (even if that cloud provider is your own data center).\nThis presentation will teach you how to use Dapr to simplify development. You'll learn how to set up Dapr locally and how to use it with your deployed applications. After this talk, you'll be ready to make your life easier with Dapr."

Finally, I intend to show how to use the haversine formula to determine the distance between where the user is and possible points of interest. I am also going to show how you can move a lot of this logic into node scripts on Cloudflare Workers, so you donât need to clutter up your client-side code.\nI intend on beginning this talk by diving into how you can use navigator.geolocation to determine where the user is, how you can build a webservice to determine where the user is based upon their public IP address, and how a node script running in Cloudflare workers can make this relatively easy.\nNext, I intend to go over the possibility that the user might want to use a location that they are not at and how to accomplish that. The United States Census Bureau publishes US Gazetteer Files. These are listings of geographic areas, for selected geographic area types. Using their places dataset and their ZIP code tabulation areas dataset, you can build tables that go from city and state to longitude and latitude and go from ZIP code to longitude and latitude. Once you have that, it is easy enough to create another web service to handle the conversion.\nFinally, I intend to show what the haversine formula is, how you can use it to calculate the distance between two GPS coordinates, and how once you have that, you can sort your dataset by that numeric distance. The haversine formula does not consider where the roads are between the two locations but since it is just a math formula, it can be run locally on the userâs system and wonât require additional API calls."

And what if it concerned something cross-cutting, something like a major framework upgrade that impacts an entire application?\nIn this session, weâll outline a strategic approach to reviewing large, complex PRs in a manageable way. Weâll look at how to evaluate so many lines of code, effectively track updates, diplomatically provide feedback, and pragmatically select what must, should, or could be done (and by whom).\nIâll draw on my own recent experience reviewing a critical pull request from a community member that clocked in at almost 900 files. It took about a month to review and approve, and another month to address follow-up pieces. While it was a laborious and less-than-ideal process, it had to be done, so I sought the best pathâand the one I found might make your life less painful too!

If you see yourself eventually working for yourself, then freelancing might be the path for you. But if you prefer the stability of a traditional job, it's probably best to stick with what you know.\nFinally, consider your finances. Quitting your job without another source of income is not a smart move.\nWith COVID-19 behind us, it's a perfect time to reassess your freelance marketplace strategy and see if there are better options out there for getting clients. This pandemic has touched the work from home movement, which means that people want digital transformations faster than ever before! That should mean good news not only in terms of revenue but also opportunities as well since automation continues moving forward at an incredible pace â making them even more valuable now too.\nIf you're looking for clients, where do you even begin?
