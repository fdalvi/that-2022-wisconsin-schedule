# THAT Wisconsin 2022
## Unofficial calendar view schedule

An unofficial calendar style view of all the activities at [THAT Wisconsin 2022](https://that.us/events/wi/2022/).

## FAQ
- The schedule seems to be outdated!

> In order to not unnecessarily ping the main THAT website, updates are currently manually triggered. I promise to update it frequently leading up-to and during the event!

- The code looks like plain HTML/CSS/JS?!!? This is 2022, why not React/Angular/Vue/Mu/Lambda/Dalle?

> Its a good idea to do things from scratch sometimes to appreciate how far we've come along in web app dev. And its good to be silly sometimes :)

- Why not use a date/time/calendar library?

> See above. Also its good to wrap your head around timezone issues once in a while :D

- I have an idea to improve this and/or want to fix some bug!

> PRs are welcome!
