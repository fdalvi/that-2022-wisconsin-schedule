It was a time when security awareness was limited, countermeasures and best practices weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t broadly applied, and attackers explored, compromised, controlled, and exfiltrated data from systems with minimal resistance. In short, enterprise IoT security sucks as bad today as that unpatched Windows NT 3.51 server with an RS-232 connected modem that IT forgot about.\nWorking globally with Fortune 500 enterprises and government agencies we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve interrogated over two million production IoT devices. Across these two million devices we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve identified threats and trends, compiled statistics, summarized compelling cases, and evaluated common offenders. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also assembled tactics that organizations can employ to recognize value from their IoT devices while minimizing risk and ensuring that devices that are secure today will stay secure tomorrow.\nSecurity issues are compounded by the quantity of IoT devices. Our analysis indicates that most organizations have about five IoT devices per employee. The global IoT market has grown from $100 billion in 2017 to over $1 trillion in 2022. There are over 46 billion connected devices today and 30 billion (65%) of those devices are IoT. We are increasingly dependent on consumer, enterprise, industrial, and military IoT devices for cost reduction, supply chain logistics, productivity gains, security, and everything in between.

Although object-oriented (oo) design remains the dominant software development paradigm, even oo-first languages have seen a shift toward the functional mindset with the emphasis on LINQ in C# and lambdas in Java. This move toward a functional style should be particularly welcome for data platform specialists, who already have a leg up in understanding functional programming concepts thanks to their work with SQL.\nIn this talk, we will focus on one functional programming language, F#. We will look at some of the basics of the language and see how you can translate knowledge of SQL into a pipeline-driven functional programming language. We will also see areas where F# integrates smoothly with SQL, creating a powerful way to extend your SQL skills beyond queries."}, {"title": "Drawing pixel art for video games", "start_time": 1658853000.0, "end_time": 1658856600.0, "location": "Room: Aralia", "description": "Want to create your own art for retro video games?

Or do they nod their head, agreeing there's a potential (maybe even small) risk, but then take no further actions to prepare for that dreaded day?\nI've been there. We talk about cyber risks and the threats they pose to our business, but the business doesn't seem to take a real interest...until the inevitable happens. We've been exposed to a potential cyber attack. An employee clicks on a phishing email and enters their credentials. The tech community is in a panic, wondering if they are affected by the newly exposed library vulnerability. A developer resigns after only 2 weeks of work...what did they do in that short amount of time?! When these things happen, the business becomes ultra sensitive to \"shiny\" threats and wants answers...fast. And because the spotlight is now on these issues, we make decisions that don't necessarily make sense or we miss the obvious.\nThis is where planning is key. We never plan to fail, but we do fail to plan which then leads to more unanswered questions, undefined risks and potentially more sleepless nights. One of the best ways I've seen to help bring cyber threats to life is to perform a tabletop exercise. A tabletop exercise joins all key parties together to simulate a real-life event. I will walk you through the steps of planning and executing this exercise with your senior leadership team as well as with your tech team. It will shake out the bugs and point out the areas where more planning is needed. If you are well prepared for the dreadful attack, it won't seem as bad because you've proactively thought through what needs to happen.\nLastly, I will give you a peek into our approach at a Cyber Attack Plan. This plan outlines different threats and is a great tool to use during a tabletop exercise. My goal is for you to leave, feeling confident about how you can plan for the inevitable - because you are never able to fully remove your cyber security risk."}, {"title": "Homemade Infinity Cube", "start_time": 1659025800.0, "end_time": 1659029400.0, "location": "Room: Aralia", "description": "Tired of long lines waiting for your next session, then come create your own fidget to relax and occupy you all in one.\nDo you or your children love using fidgets but do not like spending all the money on store bought ones?

The problem is, we tend to equate these paradigms of this type of programming with programming in general. If you are a front end developer, you will find it difficult to move to back end development even though it's the same language and everything boils down to 1s and 0s.\nIn this talk, I will speak about my personal struggles with moving from front end iOS native development to cross platform game development. I will share my insights and give you tools to help you make a change in your career if you feel like you're not doing the things you would like to be doing."}, {"title": "We're Here to Help", "start_time": 1658847600.0, "end_time": 1658851200.0, "location": "Room: F", "description": "The story of Freshwater Sauces is really the story of the power of the That Conference Community and its willingness to jump in and help a stranger inch closer to their goals.\nIn this session I'll explain how a simple question of the day on That Slack provided a year's worth of advice, contacts and mentoring that helped take my idea of starting a hot sauce company from a dream to reality.\nI'll offer advice on how you can seek out help from within this community for your goals, and how you can offer help to those who need it even if you think you have nothing to give.\nThe end of the session will feature a panel of members of the That Slack Entrepreneurship Accountability group taking questions and providing answers for whatever questions you might have.\nHelp is not something to be ashamed of, and we're here to give it."}, {"title": "Jetpack \u00f0\u009f\u009a\u0080 Compose - Creating a List (RecyclerView & Adapters no more!)", "start_time": 1658847600.0, "end_time": 1658851200.0, "location": "Online", "description": "The common approach to creating List type views in the Android world is to use a combination of XML layouts with RecyclerViews and Adapters.

In this talk, I'll dig into WHY! I'll share all the best practices and pitfalls I've crowd sourced from working with 100s of companies.
