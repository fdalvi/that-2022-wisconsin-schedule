Animations are a fun and interactive way to get users to have an experience as opposed to just using a piece of software. Animations give depth. A coat of polish if you will, to a relatively mediocre experience. I want users to engage with my software. To feel like someone really took the time and care into building this.\nThis session will cover the basics of animating with GSAP. And though I use Vue.js as template for my presentation, all the concepts shown can be easily translated into any Javascript project like React or Svelte. It will also cover the differences between animating with CSS and GSAP, when to use what and why animating with Javascript allows for more control.\nI want to inspire your campers to not just think about ways to enhance their projects, but how to take them to the next level. At the end of the day, animation is fun. I want to show people that with this simple library, they too can enhance a project further just by playing with and exploring what GSAP is capable of doing.", "link": "https://that.us//activities/WdunkBQMbkKV9tzOI8IN/"}, {"title": "Breakfast - Thursday", "start_time": 1659011400.0, "end_time": 1659015000.0, "location": "Room: Mess Hall", "description": "Get out of bed sleepy head and get some chow.

Although object-oriented (oo) design remains the dominant software development paradigm, even oo-first languages have seen a shift toward the functional mindset with the emphasis on LINQ in C# and lambdas in Java. This move toward a functional style should be particularly welcome for data platform specialists, who already have a leg up in understanding functional programming concepts thanks to their work with SQL.\nIn this talk, we will focus on one functional programming language, F#. We will look at some of the basics of the language and see how you can translate knowledge of SQL into a pipeline-driven functional programming language. We will also see areas where F# integrates smoothly with SQL, creating a powerful way to extend your SQL skills beyond queries.", "link": "https://that.us//activities/F4rRQ4JXiLD76FRe9xWD/"}, {"title": "So you want to Build an App", "start_time": 1659031200.0, "end_time": 1659034800.0, "location": "Room: African 80", "description": "You did it. You finally had that brilliant idea that is going to change the world and allow you to buy the private jet, drive a different Tesla each day of the week, and still make it home in time for dinner. While it sounds great, in the real world, the steps between here and there are unclear in the best of times.\nIn this session, we'll explore the steps after you have the idea. We'll sketch out the repeatable steps you can follow to figure out if you have a fun project or a great product, understand the space you're working in, and consider ideas on how to bring it to market.

As technologists, our brains are designed to say \"Yeah, but...\" to poke holes, to find the defects and flaws in the logic. This is what makes us great! What happens over time is we over-use this skill and it becomes our default. This workshop will show you that using more \"Yes, and...\" and the power of changing one word (but --> and) will create space for ideas to breathe and will lead to breakthroughs in problem solving you never knew were possible.\nWe'll be giving away a wellness basket including a massage gun to a lucky attendee of this talk.", "link": "https://that.us//activities/znR1VMFoo99UAg0Vte36/"}, {"title": "Reach Higher with Higher-Order Functions", "start_time": 1659036600.0, "end_time": 1659040200.0, "location": "Room: H", "description": "This talk will go a little deeper into javascript functions and functional style and how it can help you write cleaner code.", "link": "https://that.us//activities/K2r9L5q56CuxYrTaoLxS/"}, {"title": "Paper Airplane Challenge, Hovercrafts and More (Morning)", "start_time": 1658842200.0, "end_time": 1658856600.0, "location": "Room: Tamboti", "description": "Visit the family track and test your engineering skills by making paper airplanes and testing their distance and accuracy.

Although the techniques demonstrated can be used for rapid prototyping this is definitely not \u00e2\u0080\u009cDemoware\u00e2\u0080\u009d software. See how you can create the foundation of custom web applications that are architected with longevity, adaptability, and ease of maintenance in mind. Even better, all of this will work with your own database schema, or Entity Framework code-first classes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 assuming the design uses proper primary keys and foreign key relationships.\nFirst, attendees will see how to create a multi-project solution that implements separation of concerns (SoC) design principles. This will be a multi-headed Blazor solution that generates both a WebAssembly (Wasm) and a Server (SignalR) project. The benefits to this approach will be explained and the developer may choose which technology they want to deploy. Demonstration of how to create and test the application should only take about thirty minutes. The remainder of the session will be spent walking through how each piece of the architecture works and answering questions.\nWant to challenge the demo gods and do something crazy on the fly? If an audience member supplies us with an online link to their own database schema DDL I will use their provided SQL script to demonstrate just how quickly the application can adapt to change. No confidential designs, malware, poorly designed databases, huge amounts of data, or anything else designed to cause trouble or embarrass me, please! If you are interested, but not chosen for the second demonstration, I will work with you afterwards to get your own solution up and running.", "link": "https://that.us//activities/KJjnc3g3C2jqf8uoXdWm/"}, {"title": "Christmas in July?

Learn how that is not always the case in this hands-on circuit session.\nCampers, ask your parents or grandparents about when they were kids, how frustrating it was using Christmas lights, because when one light went out, they all went out! That may seem like a parallel universe today, but it was a reality then with series circuit Christmas lights. Learn why this doesn't happen anymore with today's Christmas lights by understanding the difference in series vs. parallel circuits.\nA 12-year old Christmas light fanatic, who is also the founder of Brody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Christmas Lights for Charity, will teach this hands-on session. Participants will experiment with and create their own series and parallel \"light up\" circuit projects and will learn about logical thinking, conductive paths and open vs. closed circuits and then take these projects home to continue experimenting after camp is over.", "link": "https://that.us//activities/sqljh2bdahzbrmodM8vp/"}, {"title": "How Artificial Intelligence is Transforming the World of Professional Sports", "start_time": 1659015000.0, "end_time": 1659020400.0, "location": "Room: Mess Hall", "description": "100% of all five professional sports leagues in the United States use Artificial Intelligence. By 2030 the artificial intelligence sports market will reach $19.9 billion globally. The thought of AI can be terrifying. One of the biggest fears is that Artificial Intelligence will wipe out the existence of humanity. Although people are more concerned than excited about AI, it can add human elements, even to sports.\nThink about the athlete trying to prevent lifelong injury and illness so they can pick up their grandkids one day. Or the athlete ethically enhancing their performance and dreaming about accepting their gold medal at the Olympics.\nArtificial Intelligence impacts not only professional sports but also college and youth sports. Let's go on a journey and discover how AI is revolutionizing each level of sports by exploring fascinating use cases.", "link": "https://that.us//activities/eAO3pnBsN0NerJqWMtsv"}, {"title": "\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00a1Build an Automated Home of the Future using Home Assistant hub \u00f0\u009f\u0090\u008b", "start_time": 1658955600.0, "end_time": 1658959200.0, "location": "Room: African 80", "description": "We recently went to Disney World and rode on the Carousel of Progress. In that ride we see the great advancements the world has made, but also a vision of the future (in 1964). There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a connected home with a voice assistant that uses devices around the house to do things for the family. With the IoT devices available on the market today we can have that home of the future.\nThe problem with setting up that futuristic home is you likely have a variety of different devices that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to control with a number of different platforms. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too disconnected and using an assistant like Google or Alexa can limit what you could potentially do with these cool technologies. However with Home Assistant we can collect data from a variety of different sources, run it through a workflow, and output it to any device we want on our network. The number of cool scenarios you can create is limitless.

Now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to wire up, power on, and boot some code to control it all. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a selection of solid applications for light show automation available, but maybe your idea of fun is saying \"nah - I'm gonna do my own thing\".

We built a system using a combination of our own carefully coded services, some purchased or open-source systems we deploy to VM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s or functions, and a cloud provider\u00e2\u0080\u0099s systems. It was all working so well and then... it just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too slow, it is throwing errors, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s timing out, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forcing me to put off leaving at the end of the day for a nice visit to the woods to recuperate. Looking at log messages, ok, how did that handful of systems produce that many messages. How can I look at that pile of gibberish and figure out what is going on? Running on my local computer, maybe I could debug this, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know enough to set up the matching scenario to trigger this problem. Should we add more logging? NOOOOOOO!\nOpenTelemetry helps solve this problem by standardizing how to correlate and track activities across all your systems. The language and platform specific libraries and SDK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s make it much simpler to implement tracing in your own applications and correlate activities across the whole distributed network of nodes you call home. It is usable in all platforms so much of what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll talk about is applicable to GCP, Azure and AWS. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t replace logging but being able to associate logs with traces provides a wonderful way to filter log entries. Some of the foundations of this started in Google as OpenCensus and so this way of tackling the problem is baked into how GCP works. So, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll explore the setup of a few services running in GCP with Google Trace, OpenTelemetry and Google Logging libraries and try to tame this beast. The demo will be code and query heavy, showing requests originating from REST endpoints, graphql, and pubsub. It will also show how tracing correlates those requests to CloudSql, Google Cloud Storage and other built-in systems.

There's no question that streaming is popular, but why is it so in-demand? Part of the draw for users is that streaming is unscripted, dynamic, and unpredictable. It's not the same old formulaic \"cookie-cutter\" content available via traditional mediums. Another attraction is the high level of interactivity with the content producer. What other medium provides live chat and interaction to viewers while they consume the content? Streaming gives the consumer a level of active participation in their entertainment instead of just passively consuming it. It's also highly accessible - anyone can set up a stream at little to no cost from the comfort of their own home or office - or anywhere as long as they have a modern mobile device and internet connectivity.

SLO violations can alert the team that something is wrong with your system.\nAfter learning the key terms and concepts the demo will turn interactive to work together to create several SLIs and SLIOs for an imaginary system.", "link": "https://that.us//activities/3y4dSqwX5w7RqkxcOU7K/"}, {"title": "Alan Shreve, the founder of ngrok, will explore how to load google.com", "start_time": 1658928600.0, "end_time": 1658934000.0, "location": "Room: Mess Hall", "description": "Alan Shreve, the founder of ngrok, will explore how to load google.com.", "link": "https://that.us//activities/VS2KIi4gCKCHKCkgeA2Q"}, {"title": "Ultimate Flashlight Tag and Camp Games with Arduino", "start_time": 1658869200.0, "end_time": 1658876400.0, "location": "Room: African 60", "description": "Come on in and learn about microcontrollers.

Do they really care about cyber threats and understand them?

We talk about cyber risks and the threats they pose to our business, but the business doesn't seem to take a real interest...until the inevitable happens. We've been exposed to a potential cyber attack. An employee clicks on a phishing email and enters their credentials. The tech community is in a panic, wondering if they are affected by the newly exposed library vulnerability. A developer resigns after only 2 weeks of work...what did they do in that short amount of time?! When these things happen, the business becomes ultra sensitive to \"shiny\" threats and wants answers...fast. And because the spotlight is now on these issues, we make decisions that don't necessarily make sense or we miss the obvious.\nThis is where planning is key. We never plan to fail, but we do fail to plan which then leads to more unanswered questions, undefined risks and potentially more sleepless nights. One of the best ways I've seen to help bring cyber threats to life is to perform a tabletop exercise. A tabletop exercise joins all key parties together to simulate a real-life event.

It will shake out the bugs and point out the areas where more planning is needed. If you are well prepared for the dreadful attack, it won't seem as bad because you've proactively thought through what needs to happen.\nLastly, I will give you a peek into our approach at a Cyber Attack Plan. This plan outlines different threats and is a great tool to use during a tabletop exercise. My goal is for you to leave, feeling confident about how you can plan for the inevitable - because you are never able to fully remove your cyber security risk.", "link": "https://that.us//activities/cru8t0tWY3JnIlFXo6ha/"}, {"title": "THAT 5k - Tuesday", "start_time": 1658833200.0, "end_time": 1658836800.0, "location": "Room: Kalahari Drive, South Side of Double Cut", "description": "Start the day off right, with a little walk, jog, run, whatever.
